# Helsinki Virtual Tutor Project 2022

This website is currently hosted at https://virtualtutor.azurewebsites.net/. Navigate here to begin gameplay.

## Project Description

The goal of the game is to engage students in the process of creating and playing a reading-based game. The game is supervised by a teacher, but the main aspects of the game are automated through AI, specifically a Large Language Model in the form of a Question-Answer system. The AI model will answer any question posed during the team 2’s turn of the game, but it can only provide answer’s from a fixed knowledge base (question and answer pairs created by the teacher or team 1).

## Gameplay Instructions
