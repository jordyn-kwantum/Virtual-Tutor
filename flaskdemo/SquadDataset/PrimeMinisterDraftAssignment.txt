Pehr Evind Svinhufvud af Qvalstad (15 December 1861 - 29 February 1944) was the third president of Finland from 1931 to 1937. Serving as a lawyer, judge, and politician in the Russian Grand Duchy of Finland, he played a major role in the movement for Finnish independence, he was one who presented the Declaration of Independence to the Parliament. In 1917-1918, Svinhufvud was the first Head of State of independent Finland, first as Chairman of the Senate  and subsequently as Protector of State or Regent. He also served as Prime Minister from 1930 to 1931.

As a conservative who was strong in his opposition to communism and the Left in general, Svinhufvud did not become a President embraced by all the people, although as the amiable Ukko-Pekka ("Old Man Pekka"), he did enjoy wide popularity. Svinhufvud's sharp line as a defender of Finland's legal rights during the period of autonomy was especially valued from the 1920s until the end of the World War II, unlike in later decades. Ever since communism and the Soviet Union collapsed in the early 1990s, appreciation of Svinhufvud has begun to increase.
